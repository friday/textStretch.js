It doesn't require or add any wrappers or child-elements, and it adapts to when you resize the window or flip your device.\r\n\r\ntextStretch is build with older browsers in mind. It's tested and works with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer (I haven't tested any version older than 6 though). If you can find a browser it doesn't work with, please contact me.\r\n\r\n### For further documentation, pick the version you want to use:\r\n### [jQuery](doc/jquery.md) <br/> [Regular javascript](doc/javascript.md)","google":"UA-46498856-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
